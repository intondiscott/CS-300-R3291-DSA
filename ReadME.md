<h1 align=center>📂 DSA Sorting Algorithms 📁</h1> 
<h3>🤔 What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?</h3>
<p>🥇 I was trying to solve efficiency in getting data from a *.csv file and sorting and accessing certain contents</p>
<h3>🤔 How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.</h3>
<p>🥇 First I thought what data structure would make the best sense for accessing, sorting, and modifying data while keeping speed in mind. This lead me towards a Binary Sort tree where O(log n) made the most sense in most cases.</p>
<h3>🤔 How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?</h3>
<p>🥇 I faced many roadblocks where using my Google-fu has found my answers in different ways of implementing something.</p>
<h3>🤔 How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?</h3>
<p>🥇 This has made me think about the user's experience where those may look for results in a quick manner. Users may not want to use a program that hangs on fetching data too long.</p>
<h3>🤔 How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h3>
<p>🥇 I have learned better problem-solving skills in scalable data whereas data grows time slows. The concept is important to understand writing algorithms that can efficiently handle such tasks.</p>
